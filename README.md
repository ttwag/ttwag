# Tao Wang 

Hi! I'm Tao, a third-year electrical engineering student from UC Davis. I am currently a software engineering intern for Cadence Design Systems.

## Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modernizing Cadence's EDA tool from C to C++.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about good hikes ðŸ¥¾ I've done throughout the world.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email, Linkedin
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started college as a Biochemistry major, then I switched to Electrical Engineering in my sophomore year.
